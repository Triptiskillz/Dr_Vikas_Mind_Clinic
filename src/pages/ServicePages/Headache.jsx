                                    There is yet no known cause for migraine. But it is believed that abnormal brain activities
                                    temporarily affect chemicals like estrogen and serotonin that narrow down blood vessels which
                                    ultimately contributes in a migraine or headache. Migraine and headache patients need to know
                                    what triggers their migraines.

                                Migraines and headaches are of different kinds.
                                A psychiatrist will talk to the patients about various symptoms that a patient faces.
                                Also, migraine attacks may have some triggers. Helping a patient identify triggers that lead to their
                                migraine attack is a great way to reduce occurrences of a migraine attack.
