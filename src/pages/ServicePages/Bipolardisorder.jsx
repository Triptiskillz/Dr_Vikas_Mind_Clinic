                            Patients with Bipolar Disorder go through extreme mood swings.
                            For some, there are phases of mania where they are extremely happy, confident and energetic.
                            For some, mania phases may also switch to depression episodes.
                            The length of these episodes can be for days to months.
                            There is no fixed pattern of phases of mania with/without depression. Some may only have mania;
                            some may have both mania and depression. Whereas some may have mania and depression happening at the
                             same time.
                            Also, the frequency of these phases may be frequent or rare.
                            With proper bipolar disorder treatment in Delhi, <i>such patients can keep a check on their emotions 
                                and can successfully balance their daily life.</i>

                                    The exact cause of bipolar disorder is yet not known but genetics and chemical imbalances in the brain seem to cause this
                                    disorder.
                                </p><p className="mt-2">Bipolar Disorder is risky as during periods of mania a person may make wrong decisions as they have poor
                                    judgemental power. For instance, undergoing financial decisions (like selling a house or buying something too expensive), burglary, drug offences.
                                </p><p className="mt-2">Secondly, such patients at times turn aggressive that can lead to dangerous consequences for themselves and
                                    others.
                                </p><p className="mt-2">Thirdly, in some, mania phases lead to hypersexuality thus rising chances of unprotected sex with multiple
                                    partners, rape, sexual abuse of children, unplanned pregnancy, etc.
                                </p><p className="mt-2">Fourth, during depressive phases, a person may feel suicidal.

                                    </p><p className="mt-2">Bipolar Disorder is risky as during periods of mania a person may make wrong decisions as they have poor
                                        judgemental power. For instance, undergoing financial decisions (like selling a house or buying something too expensive), burglary, drug offences.

                                    </p><p className="mt-2">Thirdly, in some, mania phases lead to hypersexuality thus rising chances of unprotected sex with multiple
                                        partners, rape, sexual abuse of children, unplanned pregnancy, etc.
