                                A neuropsychiatrist treats mental issues that arise due to some physical or neurological disorder.
                                Neuropsychiatrists plan the right line of treatment for patients after accessing their mental and physical hindrances.
                                Apart from medications, they also suggest psychotherapy for better coping skills and support/rehabilitation services that help in mental and emotional well-being.
