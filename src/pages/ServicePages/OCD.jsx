                            <i>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</i> (OCD) is a vicious cycle. A patient has fears (obsessions) that compel them to repeat behaviours (compulsions).
                            The more one tries to stop it, the more keeps on happening. It gives temporary relief only when you repeat the task.
                            And thus, the patients stay in a loop of unwanted thoughts/urges that keep on pushing them to repeat certain tasks.
                            There is a high chance that anxiety is related to OCD.
